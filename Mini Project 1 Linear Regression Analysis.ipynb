# Let's start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. We'll use the popular pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation, numerical operations, and machine learning modeling respectively. Additionally, we'll use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. Once the initial setup is done, we'll proceed with data preprocessing.

# In[ ]:


# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Loading the dataset
housing_data = pd.read_csv("housing_dataset.csv")

# Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
print(housing_data.head())


# This code sets up our notebook by importing the required libraries and loads the housing dataset into a pandas DataFrame. 
# Now, let's move on to the data preprocessing step where we'll handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and 
# visualize the data.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Handling missing values
# Check for missing values
missing_values = housing_data.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

# Fill missing values with mean or median
housing_data.fillna(housing_data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Feature engineering
# You can perform feature engineering based on domain knowledge or insights from data exploration.
# For demonstration, let's say we create a new feature 'total_rooms' by summing up 'bedrooms' and 'bathrooms'.
housing_data['total_rooms'] = housing_data['bedrooms'] + housing_data['bathrooms']

# Data visualization
# Visualize the distribution of target variable 'price'
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(housing_data['price'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of House Prices')
plt.xlabel('Price')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Visualize the correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(housing_data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()


# In these steps:
# 
# We first check for missing values in the dataset and fill them with either mean or median values.
# Then, we perform a simple feature engineering task where we create a new feature 'total_rooms' by summing up the number 
# of bedrooms and bathrooms.
# Finally, we visualize the distribution of the target variable 'price' using a histogram and the correlation matrix of
# all features using a heatmap.

# Let's continue by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, followed by model fitting and evaluation using linear regression.

# In[ ]:


# Splitting the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = housing_data.drop(columns=['price'])  # Features
y = housing_data['price']                 # Target variable

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model fitting
# Initialize the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model evaluation
# Predicting house prices on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
print("R-squared (R2) Score:", r2)


# In these steps:
# 
# We split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
# Then, we split the data into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.
# Next, we initialize a linear regression model, fit it on the training data, and make predictions on the testing set.
# Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

# In[ ]:


# Discussion
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
print("R-squared (R2) Score:", r2)

# Analyzing model accuracy
# R-squared (R2) score measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.
# A higher R2 score closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

# Potential biases in the dataset
# It's important to consider potential biases in the dataset that might affect the model's predictions.
# Biases could arise from features such as location, demographics, or socioeconomic factors.

# Possible improvements
# 1. Feature engineering: Explore additional features or transformations that could improve the model's performance.
# 2. Regularization techniques: Apply regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting.
# 3. Handling outliers: Identify and handle outliers in the data which may adversely affect the model's performance.
# 4. Ensemble methods: Try ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting which may capture non-linear 
relationships better.

# Conclusion
# In this notebook, we applied linear regression to predict housing prices using a real estate dataset.
# The model achieved a certain level of accuracy, but there is room for improvement through further exploration
and refinement of features, as well as experimenting with different modeling techniques.


# This discussion section provides insights into the model's accuracy, potential biases in the dataset, and possible improvements to enhance the predictive performance of the model.

# Let's expand on each point further and add additional analysis based on specific requirements.
# 
# Analyzing Model Accuracy:
# 
# Besides evaluating the model using MSE and R2 score, we can also analyze the distribution of residuals (the differences between predicted and actual values). Plotting a histogram of residuals can help us understand if the model has any systematic biases or if it's making consistent errors across different ranges of house prices.
# Potential Biases in the Dataset:
# 
# We can delve deeper into potential biases by examining the distribution of housing prices across different locations, demographics, or socioeconomic factors. Are certain neighborhoods consistently overvalued or undervalued by the model? 
# Are there disparities in predicted prices for houses with similar features but located in different areas?
# Additionally, we can investigate if there are any underrepresented groups in the dataset that might lead to biased predictions. For example, if the dataset primarily includes houses from affluent neighborhoods, the model may not generalize well to lower-income areas.
# Possible Improvements:
# 
# Feature Engineering:
# Explore interactions between features or nonlinear transformations that could capture more complex relationships in the data.
# Consider incorporating external data sources such as crime rates, school quality, or proximity to amenities, which could provide valuable information for predicting housing prices.
# Regularization Techniques:
# Experiment with different regularization parameters in models like Lasso or Ridge regression to find the optimal balance between bias and variance.
# Handling Outliers:
# Identify outliers that significantly impact the model's performance and consider strategies such as removing them, transforming the target variable, or using robust regression techniques.
# Ensemble Methods:
# Implement ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features more effectively than linear regression alone.
# Model Interpretability:
# Explore methods for interpreting the model's predictions, such as feature importance analysis or partial dependence plots, to gain insights into which features are driving the predictions and how they affect housing prices.
# Conclusion:
# 
# Summarize the key findings from the analysis and outline next steps for further refinement of the model. This could include collecting additional data, experimenting with different modeling techniques, or conducting more in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the data.
# 

# To further refine the model, we can consider several approaches, including collecting additional data, experimenting with different modeling techniques, and conducting more in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the data.
# 
# Collecting Additional Data:
# 
# Gather supplementary data sources that may provide valuable insights into housing prices. This could include information on neighborhood amenities, crime rates, school quality, transportation infrastructure, and demographic trends.
# Incorporate historical housing market data to capture long-term trends and seasonality, which can help improve the model's predictive performance.
# Experimenting with Different Modeling Techniques:
# 
# Explore a wider range of machine learning algorithms beyond linear regression. Ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost may better capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features.
# Consider deep learning approaches, such as neural networks, for more complex modeling tasks. Neural networks have the ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data, potentially uncovering intricate patterns that traditional models may miss.
# Conducting More In-Depth Exploratory Analysis:
# 
# Perform feature importance analysis to identify the most influential variables driving housing prices. This can guide feature selection and help prioritize which variables to focus on for further refinement.
# Utilize advanced visualization techniques, such as dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP, to uncover underlying structures in the data that may not be apparent from traditional scatter plots or heatmaps.
# Implement clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups of houses with similar characteristics, which can inform targeted pricing strategies or reveal market segments that are currently underserved.
# Addressing Data Imbalance and Biases:
# 
# Investigate potential biases in the dataset, such as underrepresentation of certain demographic groups or neighborhoods, and implement strategies to mitigate these biases. This may involve oversampling minority groups, collecting additional data from underrepresented areas, or using bias correction techniques during model training.
# Perform fairness evaluations to ensure that the model's predictions are equitable across different demographic groups and geographic regions. Evaluate the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) separately for different subgroups to identify any disparities and take corrective actions as necessary.
# By implementing these strategies, we can iteratively refine the model and develop a more accurate and robust predictive tool for estimating housing prices. It's essential to continuously evaluate the model's performance and incorporate feedback from domain experts to ensure that the predictions are meaningful and actionable in real-world scenarios.
